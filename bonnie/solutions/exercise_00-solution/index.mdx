# Hey this is Bonnie ðŸ‘‹

REMEMBER: please **don't look at the solutions** before you **try to do the actual exercise yourself**.

Even if it's hard, the fact that you try (and maybe fail) will **help you learn MUCH faster**!

It's OK to fail! It's OK to not understand everything at first.

Just try! (maybe) fail... and learn!

Only use the rest of these solutions it if you're really really REALLY stuck and can't find your way out.

In the meantime...

Happy exercising! ðŸŽ½ðŸ’ªðŸ¤“
